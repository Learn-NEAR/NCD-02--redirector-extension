# Redirector Browser Extension

Redirector is an extension suggesting possible forwards for user-generated resources. It is like HTTP 301/302 (Redirect) but initiated by extension, not by the server. It allows creating a redirect for some URL even if the hoster doesnâ€™t provide this functionality.
 
In the MVP the list of redirects is stored on [GitHub](https://github.com/dapplets/community-redirector-registry). Please create a pull request to add more redirects. In the next versions of the Redirector, the list of redirects will be decentralized and community-driven.
